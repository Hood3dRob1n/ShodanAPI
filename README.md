ShodanAPI
=========

This is the Shodan API Class &amp; Search tool that I wrote in Ruby since their default API wasn't working for me. You can either drop the API class in and use how you like or you can  just use or tweak the tool I made iwth it. Open to questions, suggestions and general feedback...
